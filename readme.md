# Why this repo?

- For low latency applications, we strive to eliminate all possible sources of latency.
- To reduce latency, we need to be aware of (as per my current understanding) operating system (system calls, memory allocations, scheduler, etc.), other processes, compiler optimizations, cache system, thread synchronization, etc.
- I know all of above stuff on surface, but I need to deep dive into each of above topic (and any that is not listed above) to hopefully secure a job in low latency trading role :).
- In this repo, I will try to categorize my learning plan (can extend upto a year), and will refer resources that I am going to use throughout my journey.
- Additionally, I am going to work on a project to build a trading system, and the basic design will be taken from a book.
